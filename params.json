{"name":"Web Accessibility Project Page","tagline":"web_accessibility","body":"### Welcome to Our Project Pages.\r\nThis page is for our project in CS770 Human-Computer Interaction. The project is to build a tool that helps check the accessibility of a webpage and encourages web developers build a more accessible website.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAchin Kulshrestha, Akshay Uttamani, Chih-Ching Chang\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
